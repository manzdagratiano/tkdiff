4.2             (2011):
     * Works with Subversion 1.7
     * Make opening file dialog know where it started from, and start in the
       same directory as the first file when looking for the second one.
     * You can now specify a preference for filetypes for the file open/save
       dialogs.
     * Detect PVCS by environment variable (patch 1839361 by nafmo)
     * Update BitKeeper support (patch 3053551 by wscott)
     * Mercurial support (patch 1867700 by damonmc)
     * Rudimentary Git support (patch 1836293 by cecilh3)
     * add help menu items to report versions of wish and diff
     * Fix location of temp files on MacOS X
     * Gave it a debug (-d) option

4.1.4           (11/15/2007):
     * Ignore -u option from svn for usage "svn diff --diff-cmd=tkdiff"
     * Perforce support for P4CONFIG environment variable
     * Remove an old font work-around for Mac, but add a new one for tk8.5
        on Windows
     * Fix duplicate keyboard accelerator for Preferences

4.1.3		(2/20/2006):
     * Fixed incompatibility with older versions of Tcl/Tk
       ("-state disabled").
     * Applied Warren Jones' subversion patch, which prevents the
       svn error that occurs when you omit a revision number.

4.1.2           (2/1/2006):
     * Can now do "tkdiff OLD-URL[@OLDREV] NEW-URL[@NEWREV]" in Subversion

4.1.1           (12/20/2005):
     * Security patch for temp files (CVE-2005-4434)

4.1             (7/4/2005):

     * Clearcase support
     * Better Subversion support
     * -L command line option allows you to control the labels above the
       diff file panes.
     * tkdiff --help or -h print a usage message for command line without
       invoking the GUI.
     * The New Diff Dialog is expanded so you can specify all the options.
     * The two panes can be resized relative to each other using a sash
       widget.  Tk8.4 is recommended, since the implemetation is much better.

      on Windows when the user name had a space in it.
    * Made diff "edge detection" smarter by using the new smarter overlap code
      for cases where diff decided to treat whitespace slightly different
      on missing-EOL files when doing 3-way diffs.

      when appropriate.

    * slight modification for how change bars are colored
    * bug fix for up/down arrow keys (they were moving by
      two lines instead of one)

      for a few other alt- combinations)
    * fixed a couple of -underline options for menus
    * new preferences for enabling the display of the 
      line comparison window, and for configuring how 
      individual characters are highlighted in that window
    * added "<file> vs. <file>" to the window title 
      (eg: foo-old.txt vs. foo.txt - TkDiff 3.03) -- this 
      more closely aligns with Windows standards, and is
      equally useful on other platforms, I suppose
    * online help has been updated to reflect these changes

        + As of 3.00: (11/06/1998)
                A new GUI.
                No more reliance on perl...  It's 100% Tcl/Tk now.
                Built-in editor.
                A "find" facility.
                Lots more...  And all of this thanks to Bryan Oakley!

        + GPL'ed (as of 2.03).

        + RCS, CVS and SCCS support (auto-detected)...  Even more SCM
          systems are supported in 3.00.

        + Highlighted difference regions, randomly accessible, with a
          quick overview/navigation bar.

        + Side-by-side viewing and linked (synchronized) scrolling of files.

        + On-line help and extensive customization (also much-improved in
          3.00).

        + File-merge and change-summary facilities.

        + Line-number toggling (for easier cut & paste), with extra goodies
          as of 3.00.

        + Windows NT support.

...and more stuff I can't even remember, probably.

Much work has been done by Bryan Oakley for this release (in fact, 99%
of it). :-)  Thanks, Bryan!  Keep an eye on the tkdiff home page at
http://www.ipass.net/~klassa/tkdiff for developments...  I don't think
there'll be many, at this point -- Bryan has turned this thing into just
about all you could ask for!  If you have problems, though, please send
bug reports (better yet, patches :-)) against 3.00 to klassa@ipass.net.
